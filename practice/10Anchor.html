    <h1>Anchor Tag In HTML</h1>

    <p>
      The <b>a> tag</b> defines a hyperlink, which is used to link from one page
      to another.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most important attribute of the <b>a></b> element is the
      <b>href</b> attribute, which indicates the link's destination.

    By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers: <br /><br />
    <li>An unvisited link is underlined and blue</li>
    <li>A visited link is underlined and purple</li>
    <li>An active link is underlined and red</li>
